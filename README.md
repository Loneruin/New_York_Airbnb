# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
In this project, the dataset consisted of a table of Airbnb listings in New York from 2008 to 2014. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data, I created 8 visualizations to identify patterns, trends, and predict future profit. During the process of building the dashboard, I revised my questions as needed.

## Process
1. Classify and quantify the information
2. Generate questions
3. Evaluate crucial factors affecting Airbnb profits
4. Represent data graphically
5. Discover significant patterns and tendencies
6. Develop a visual representation for presentation purposes.
